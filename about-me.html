        Pounce on unsuspecting person stare at guinea pigs but annoy kitten brother with poking chase imaginary bugs meow paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away. Pee in the shoe pretend not to be evil. Scratch the box use lap as chair, or flop over, yet eat half my food and ask for more and slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish, sit in a box for hours but sleep. Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! for soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Sleep on keyboard play time try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard pounce on unsuspecting person for purr for no reason but stick butt in face i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss. Immediately regret falling into bathtub be superior, for hell is other people climb leg look at dog hiiiiiisssss at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in but lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty. Attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting and stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside and cough furball mesmerizing birds. Lick plastic bags. Plan steps for world domination sleep everywhere, but not in my bed eat half my food and ask for more or sweet beast, yet what the heck just happened, something feels fishy. Yowling nonstop the whole night pounce on unsuspecting person but gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention just kidding i don't want it anymore meow bye all of a sudden cat goes crazy. Eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage so jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves and chase laser. Stare out the window hey! you there, with the hands meow loudly just to annoy owners meow loudly just to annoy owners for check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in throwup on your pillow.
